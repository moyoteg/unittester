Welcome to the Vivint Resource Manager Unit Tester Server
=========================

The server is written with `NodeJS` and `Express`.

**Vivint Resource Manager Unit Tester Server** goal is to create the server scenarios that the Mobile apps have to face in order to be `defensive`.

If you would like to look at the source code please follow the link [source Vivint Unit Tester](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/thread-adjustment).


Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
